### The CPS Security Challenge Sentinel Solves

Cyber-Physical Systems face sophisticated threats that traditional cybersecurity cannot address:
- **Stealthy Signal Manipulation**: Attackers inject subtle, periodic patterns that evade magnitude-based detection
- **Cross-Domain Attacks**: Simultaneous targeting of physical sensors and cyber infrastructure
- **False Positive Avalanche**: Traditional methods generate excessive alerts, overwhelming security teams
- **Threshold Complexity**: Different sensor types requiring individual tuning and maintenance

Current anomaly detection systems fail because they focus on **how much** signals change rather than **how the fundamental characteristics** of signals are altered by sophisticated attacks.

### Our Revolutionary Solution: Frequency-Domain Signal Intelligence

Sentinel's breakthrough methodology analyzes the **frequency characteristics** of sensor reconstruction errors using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), detecting subtle periodic patterns that indicate coordinated attacks.
