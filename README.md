# Sentinel: Advanced Cyber Resilience & Forensic Simulation Framework (Public Preview)

## Overview

Welcome to the public preview of Sentinel, a project dedicated to advancing cyber resilience through cutting-edge simulation and the development of sophisticated cyber forensic capabilities. Sentinel aims to create a dynamic framework for modeling complex cyber-physical environments, simulating diverse attack scenarios, and leveraging artificial intelligence to provide deep forensic insights.

Our motivation is to address the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats that pose significant risks to organizations, including financial loss, operational disruption, and data compromise.

## Vision & Core Goals

The Sentinel project is driven by the following vision and goals:

*   **Enhance Cyber Defenses:** To build a robust simulation platform that allows for the testing and validation of defensive strategies in realistic virtual environments.
*   **Rapid Incident Understanding:** To develop capabilities that enable quick and accurate understanding of security incidents, identifying root causes, scope, and impact.
*   **AI-Driven Forensics:** To explore and integrate advanced AI and machine learning techniques (such as those enabled by platforms like NVIDIA Morpheus) for automated and in-depth forensic analysis of simulated incidents.
*   **Vulnerability Correlation:** To investigate methods for correlating observed behaviors and artifacts within the simulation to known vulnerabilities and attack patterns (e.g., NVD/CVE).

## Key Concepts & Planned Capabilities

Sentinel is being designed around several key concepts:

*   **Realistic Environment Simulation:** Creating detailed virtual models of IT/OT networks, including diverse devices, user behaviors, and data flows.
*   **Advanced Forensic Data Generation:** Simulating the rich, multi-modal data crucial for forensic analysis, such as network traffic (PCAPs), endpoint logs, cloud service logs, and IoT device interactions.
*   **Sophisticated Attack Scenario Modeling:** Developing modules to simulate a wide array of cyber-attacks, from phishing and social engineering to hardware compromises and cloud service abuse.
*   **AI-Powered Analytical Pipeline:** Designing and exploring an analysis pipeline that uses AI/ML to process simulated forensic data, identify attack vectors, classify threats, and assess severity.

## What This Public Preview Represents

This repository provides a high-level overview of the Sentinel project's vision, objectives, conceptual architecture, and ongoing research areas. It's a space to share our journey and the broad strokes of what we aim to achieve.

**Please Note:** The core implementation, proprietary algorithms, and detailed source code of the Sentinel project are kept private and are not part of this public preview. This repository focuses on the "what" and "why" rather than the specific "how" of our internal development.

## Focus Areas of Development

Our research and development efforts are currently centered on:

*   **Building a Flexible Simulation Core:** Developing a highly adaptable SimPy-based environment for generating realistic data.
*   **Integrating AI for Deep Forensics:** Researching and planning the integration of AI frameworks like NVIDIA Morpheus for advanced analysis of simulated incident data.
*   **Automated Vulnerability Assessment:** Designing systems to link simulated attack artifacts with real-world vulnerability information.
*   **Sensor Architecture for Comprehensive Data Collection:** Conceptualizing diverse virtual sensors to capture a wide array of forensic data.

## Technology Exploration (Conceptual)

We are exploring and leveraging technologies in the following areas:

*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Simulation Frameworks:** Investigating discrete-event simulation libraries like SimPy.
*   **AI/ML for Cybersecurity:** Researching platforms like NVIDIA Morpheus and libraries such as scikit-learn and RAPIDS cuML for forensic analysis and performance acceleration.
*   **Data Management:** Utilizing PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for handling time-series sensor data from simulations.

## High-Level Roadmap (Conceptual Phases)
